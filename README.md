# ML-sklearn-example
Example of sklearn usage. 

There are 2 files, the one that somewhat worked is random_forest, I tried with regretrion but didnt work. 

Best fit was 200 but It wasnt as close as I would like. 

## How to test. 
Simple do a pip insall - r requirements.txt 
and run file random_forest.py. 


## What does it do. 

It does the fitting (saves the model) and tries a prediction.
